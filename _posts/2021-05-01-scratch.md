title: "Introduction to Programming with Scratch"

Starting today, [CS50's Introduction to Programming with Scratch](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-programming-with-scratch) is now available on edX.

This is the third course I've developed on CS50's team, after [Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-web-programming-with-python-and-javascript) and [Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-artificial-intelligence-with-python).

The new Scratch course is designed for students who have little to no programming background, and covers concepts like functions, events, values, conditions, loops, variables, and abstraction.
