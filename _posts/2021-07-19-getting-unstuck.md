This past week saw the launch of [Getting Unstuck](https://gettingunstuck.gse.harvard.edu/), a 10-module intermediate Scratch curriculum to help students develop creative and conceptual fluency with code.

For the past year, I've been fortunate enough to have the opportunity to work with the [Creative Computing Lab](https://creativecomputing.gse.harvard.edu/) at Harvard's [Graduate School of Education](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/) on developing this curriculum, and I'm so excited to see it released! The curriculum is organized into self-contained modules, each of which contains activities to help students explore, creative, share, and reflect as they design projects that matter to them.

I've had such a wonderful time working with [Karen Brennan](https://scholar.harvard.edu/kbrennan), [Paulina Haduong](https://paulinahaduong.com/), [Mary Adelaide Williamson](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/staff/mary-adelaide-williamson), and others at the Creative Computing Lab to help bring this curriculum to life. I hope you enjoy exploring the curriculum!
