title: "Tenacity: A Computational Thinking Game"
---

This week, I'm releasing [Tenacity](https://tenacity.brianyu.me), a web-based game that focuses on principles of computational thinking. I created it as part of a course I'm taking with [Chris Dede](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/faculty/christopher-dede) at [Harvard Graduate School of Education](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/).

The game follows a space rover called Tenacity (which, incidentally, was one of the [finalists](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8588/nine-finalists-chosen-in-nasas-mars-2020-rover-naming-contest/) in NASA's naming contests for the rover that was ultimately named [Perseverance](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/)). Players guide Tenacity through missions on four different planets by clicking on block-like instructions to assemble a program to complete an objective.

Each of the planets focuses on introducing a different concept from the world of programming and computational thinking: Mercury introduces functions, Venus introduces loops, Earth introduces conditions, and Mars introduces variables.

The game is open-source and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/brianyu28/tenacity).
