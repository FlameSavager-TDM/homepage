# Spanning Tree

In Fall 2019, I took [Education T550](https://twitter.com/tfivefifty) with [Karen Brennan](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/faculty/karen-brennan) at Harvard's Graduate School of Education and worked on a project called [Spanning Tree](https://spanningtree.me/) designing animated visual explanations of topics in computer science.
Since then, I've continued to create videos on topics I find interesting.
